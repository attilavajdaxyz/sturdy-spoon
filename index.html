    <h2>Aprilis 15 2022</h2>
    <p>I listened to this great podcast today on <a href="https://www.lifespanpodcast.com/">Lifespan</a>. I tried to solve the Mexican Wave algorithm. I don't know what to write, I read some of Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby. I did a bit of p5.js, I can draw a circle and draw with a circle. I played the piano and improvised with simple harmonic structures II-V-I block chords, varying the height, strength and length of sound, creating contrast. I wrote the morning pages as part of my creative recovery doing the Artist's Way book. The weather is great. I am trying to do intermittent fasting. We ran with the dog. I played modal improvisation on the guitar and I am happy for the progress I made, I am listening to timber and found that there is a rich array of sound that I can create. I watched a video on herbs. Playing the piano and practicing making music is beneficial for my mental health, for my neurological system. I found a cool music station which is <a href="Sonic Universe at Soma FM"></a>. I am not sure if using <code>div</code> is accessible or not. I used many <code>div</code> in this blog, but I had the idea to exchange those <code>div</code>s with semantic tags. Wow, VS Code displays all the html tags when I type the opening character of a tag. Oh yes, I can talk a blue streak. 😉</p>

    <h2 class="daily-post-title">Aprilis 14 2022</h2>
    <p>I recall reading an article about <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/neubrutalism-is-taking-over-the-web-e9d09e0fe441"> neobrutalism taking over the internet</a>. I think I have elements of that in my design. I started doing the <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html"></a>Express.js tutorial docs</a>. I can create a server that says "Hello World!"</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        const express = require(express)
        const app = express()
        const port = 3000

        app.get('/', (res, req) => {
          res.send('Hello World')
        })
        
        app.listen(port => () {
          console.log(`Example app is listening on ${port}`)
        })
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>I memorised this snippet, there is more on <a href="https://fundamentals-of-piano-practice.readthedocs.io/chapter1/ch1_topics/III.6.html?highlight=memorize#a-why-memorize">memorizing here in this free piano play book.</a> I read somewhere that understanding something is more important than memorisation. <code>${port}</code> is a template literal with which we can exit JavaScript code inside strings enclosed in backticks.</p>

    <p>I kept practicing II-V-I chord progression with "drop two" voicings from the Bill Dobbins book. I progress slowly, but I learn to respect my pace and to be grateful for doing the exercises on my level. For GitHub repository names I use the prompted repository names on GitHub, I find those names fun. <a href="http://whatsthistao.com/">What's This Tao All About</a> is a great podcast.</p>

    <p>I haven't written anything to this blog for a few days. I am trying to recall what I learned, it would be a good exercise in learning. I read an article on accessibility. I started doing the Ruby course on codecademy. I remember learning about chaining methods. For example <code>print name.upcase.reverse</code> prints the name variable to the console. <code>puts</code> prints to the console also. I like the design of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby">codecademy</a>. It would be cool to be able to design like that.</p>

    <p>I applied to a few apprenticeships. I practiced eartraining on <a href="https://tonedear.com">tonedear.com</a> I also practiced "drop two" voicings on the piano and the II-V-I progression, quite slowly.</p>

    <p>This is mental renewal. I use recall that I learned at coursera course. I recall reading the Critical Thinking book, accuracy, clarity. I applied to an apprenticeship and I realised that I can learn from the questions that are presented in the assessment tests. I did a code pomodoro. I learnt some Ruby and basics of programming from these articles intro to Ruby <a href="https://blog.makersacademy.com/coding101-an-intro-to-ruby-methods-3cb6b7904c5a">Methods</a> and <a href="https://blog.makersacademy.com/coding101-ruby-classes-explained-b0645a721288">Classes</a>.  puts, print, methods, blocks., <a href="https://try.ruby-lang.org/">Try Ruby Tutorial</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby">Ruby Tutorial: Learn Ruby For Free | Codecademy</a>. I practised harmony from Bill Dobbins Creative Harmony. Learnt about tonic, dominant, subdominant chords and that one chord follows another. II-V-I is common chord progression in jazz. I did some yoga in the morning, there is a great rain.</p>

    <p>I progressed with the Mexican Wave challenge. I wrote my first functional function. I abstracted a function. <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">Higher Order Functions</a>

    <p>I am thinking of using inline styles. To create a grid, so that the blogpost is contained in the HTML document. I guess using the class attribute makes more sense. The previous portfolio that I created is this: <a href="https://attilavajdaxyz.github.io/legendary-engine/">legendary-engine</a>, on GitHub. I will use this blog as the main document project. I am reading a few code and design related weekly newsletters and I found an article on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/add-less/">adding less to a page</a> and this is what I am trying to practice here.</p>
    
    <p>This is great experience, it reminds me and recreates my earlier experience with the internet where I had fun sharing things, like music etcetera. So, for example I like this song I am listening to on Spotify: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvT2sJtNtgU"> Sakla Beni - Kutiman Melike Sahin</a> and I love the cover <img class="inline-img" src="images/sakla-beni-cover.png" alt="sakla beni album cover - glitch, typography" />  I don't know what is a good way of pasting it here, with the video thumbnail or as a simple link. It would be interesting to create here a sort of digital sketchbook, process book similar to what we created at uni. It feels good to share this stuff. There is the inspiration. I guess I missed out on the early site building, blogging experience.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUpJqEpAgv0">Ray M'bele - Orchestra Baobab</a></p>

    <!-- this is daily blogbejegyzes 2022 aprilis 5 -->
    <h2 class="daily-post-title">avril 5 Mardi 2022 start of a blog</h2>
    <p>This is my blog that I write about my code learning and creative recovery. I have been doing yoga for many years, and learnt some Qi Gong which serves me well, I draw and paint, photograph and like studying and doing art. I am learning martial arts like brazilian jiu jitsu and judo and karate. I also like climbing and to listen to mountaineering podcasts 🏔. 

    <p>The thoughtprocess behind this blog is that I have been learning to code for a year and a half and I felt the need to document the process in the code medium. It would have been great, so I will do it now. I am hoping to improve in writing and thinking by blogging. I did the Artist's Way method and developed the habit of writing three pages everyday as a journal and I would like to create something similar in the blog form for code and design. It would be an opportunity to post links and articles that I find helpful in learning. Learning to code is fun. I am thinking to do an apprenticeship or junior position where I am mentored. I am mainly learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and the basics of design. Along these I am learning Unix, VS Code, Ruby, regular expressions, accessibility, Figma and many other things that I cannot remember at the moment. I will try to keep this page simple and accessible. I will add a transition animation for links which I borrowed from <a href="https://devdocs.io/">DevDocs</a>. Coding is cool :)</p>

    <p>This is a cool website for learning accessibility: <a href="https://a11yphant.com/">A11yphant - I found it in a weekly newsletter.</a></p>

    <p>This morning I was doing a "code pomodoro", I set the clock for 25-30 minutes and I spend this time trying to solve an algorithm. At the moment I am solving challenges at Codewars. I solved the JavaScript algorithms at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"">freeCodeCamp</a> two times, which was a great experience, and it was cool to see the different versions of solutions and to learn from those. It is great that by regularly spending time with learning to code and solving algorithms I got somewhat familiar with with using a programming language. For me coding is a career change and it is quite beneficial for my mental health. When I started learning I didn't understand the simplest things. So while trying to solve this algorithm I figured out something simple and had the idea to put it into writing.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/58f5c63f1e26ecda7e000029">This is the challenge that I was trying to solve - Mexican Wave</a> where the input <code>‘Hello,hEllo,heLlo,helLo,hellO’</code> should return <code>[‘Hello’, ‘hEllo’, ‘heLlo’, ‘helLo’, ‘hellO’]</code>, and instead it returns the output: <code>[‘Hello’, ‘hEllo’, ‘heLlo’, ‘heLlo’, ‘hellO’]</code> and I had to look at this result for a while, and to experiment to find what the problem was.</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        function wave(str){
          // Code here
          let result = []
          for (let character of str) { 
            result.push(
              str.replace(character, character.toUpperCase())
            ) 
          }
          console.log(result)
          return result
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>I am practicing debugging and writing, creating a technical blog entry, as a sort of baby step. I came accross this problem where at first sight of looking at the result I couldn’t spot what the problem was.  ‘heLlo’, ‘heLlo’ should be ‘heLlo’, ‘helLo’ and my solution is to use ,<code>for (key in string)</code> instead of <code>for (character of string)</code>  - this seems good practice for writing and thinking. Also, I am practicing thinking in terms of code and understanding how I think in JavaScript. This is a great article and collection of JavaScript shorthand techniques, this is where I found the key in and character of shorthands <a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/30-awesome-javascript-shorthand-techniques-that-are-good-to-know-6590545ced3d">30 Awesome JavaScript Shorthand Techniques That You Should Know</a>. I did a « code pomodoro » just now and this is what came up. I do a pomodoro, 25-30 minutes of trying to solve an algorithm on Codewars. I focus on process. It helps to write stuff on a sheet of paper, I find that it contributes to the solution. The idea of these writings is to learn to think and write in plain English. The pomodoro is focused thinking and then I try to allow for diffused mode thinking. I could fill a digital page with writing and thinking in a similar style. But now we will walk with the dog, or run if my knee allows it.</p>
