            <p>the idea is to further develop the pebble-shop idea and realise ideas from figma sketches</p>
            <h3>thought process</h3>
            <p>‚Äúcontinue this‚Äù no title or anything needed, just develop this further
this is a cool idea üòå</p>

            <h4>‚Äúthe nameless‚Äù</h4>
            <p>this there is a 10 day gong that I do form the What‚Äôs This Tao All About podcast? http://whatsthistao.com/   ‚åòK is for making a link. and there is a ten day gong there and for two minutes I do look at things around me and say that ‚Äúthis is an object it has no name‚Äù</p>

            <p>at the LCC course we were introduced to a practice of naming things. it is interesting to name things</p>

            <p>‚Äúthe way you can go isn‚Äôt the real way. the name you can say isn‚Äôt the real name.‚Äù</p>

            <p>I chose the designer who codes title because I liked the thoughtbot application title, I adopted it. The idea is to work in atomic projects and not on one masterpiece. I remember at LondonMet Dave was talking about how Picasso would not work on a masterpiece, but have a timeline of work and that it is possible to create in SETS, SEQUENCES and SERIES. So for example (and this can be an atomic project to demonstrate what this means ü¶è)</p>

            <p>Idea is to have themes like O'Reilly's illustrations of animals, and perhaps have an animal as theme.</p>
