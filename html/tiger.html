            <h3>mai 2022 4</h3>
            <p>the idea is to further develop the pebble-shop idea and realise ideas from figma sketches</p>
            <h3>thought process</h3>
            <p>‚Äúcontinue this‚Äù no title or anything needed, just develop this further
this is a cool idea üòå</p>

            <h4>‚Äúthe nameless‚Äù</h4>
            <p>this there is a 10 day gong that I do form the What‚Äôs This Tao All About podcast? http://whatsthistao.com/   ‚åòK is for making a link. and there is a ten day gong there and for two minutes I do look at things around me and say that ‚Äúthis is an object it has no name‚Äù</p>

            <p>at the LCC course we were introduced to a practice of naming things. it is interesting to name things</p>

            <p>‚Äúthe way you can go isn‚Äôt the real way. the name you can say isn‚Äôt the real name.‚Äù</p>

            <p>RAKU, Wabi Sabi, pottery, the art of THE STUDIO POTTERY MOVEMENT ‚Äúman if i continue this i will feel blissed out all the time ü•ë‚Äù2021 dec 30 - Draw anything, make atomic design</p>

            <h3>PORTFOLIO</h3>   
            <img src="../images/portfolio-initial-drawing.png" alt="initial draft drawing, sketch for portfolio structure" />
            
            <p>I chose the designer who codes title because I liked the thoughtbot application title, I adopted it. The idea is to work in atomic projects and not on one masterpiece. I remember at LondonMet Dave was talking about how Picasso would not work on a masterpiece, but have a timeline of work and that it is possible to create in SETS, SEQUENCES and SERIES. So for example (and this can be an atomic project to demonstrate what this means ü¶è)</p>

            <p>Idea is to have themes like O'Reilly's illustrations of animals, and perhaps have an animal as theme.</p>

            <h3>hello world!</h3>

            <h3>Hi, I am Attila</h3>
            <p>a designer who codes</p>
            <img src="../images/watercolor-002.png" alt="watercolor abstract painting on recycled rag" />
            <p>this idea is to make a JavaScript algorithm that takes a random letter and adds it to the string which is displayed on the screen - character generator</p>

            <h3>TRANSCRIBING ETSY</h3>
            <p>the other day I sold two paintings on Etsy for the first time and I very much liked the website‚Äôs new design. I didn‚Äôt know how I could research and document research for ideas I liked and this is an opportunity that presented itself which I am glad for. I mean pasting this screenshot here. This page in Figma also can be a design and UX thinking can be applied to it. It can be analysed and contextual theorietical thinking can be applied and further developed and it is a digital sketchbook also. Can be.</p>

            <h3>GRADIENTS</h3>
            <img src="../images/gradient-001.png" alt="color gradient" >
            <p>thoughtprocess: I learnt to make this linear gradient in CSS on freeCodeCamp and I noticed that sunsets have similar gradients. So I photographed sky and used the colors with color picker for CSS gradient exercises.</p>
